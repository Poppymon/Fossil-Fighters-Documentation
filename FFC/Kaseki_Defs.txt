This file determines the data for the various fossils. For you see, "kaseki" is Japanese for
"fossil."

0x08 is the part of the fossil: 01 = Head, 02 = Body, 03 = Arms, 04 = Legs, and 05 = Single
(Egg, Curious, etc.).

0x10 is the ID of the vivosaur this fossil matches up with. Every vivosaur needs to be matched to
no fossils, one of all four parts, or a Single one, or the game will break.

0x18 is the ID of the rock. This is often the number in the file name, but as we go through the
list it gets more and more untethered from that.
