This file determines the data for the various fossils. For you see, "kaseki" is Japanese for
"fossil."

0x08 is the part of the fossil: 01 = Head, 02 = Body, 03 = Arms, 04 = Legs, and 05 = Single
(Egg, Curious, etc.).

0x10 is the ID of the vivosaur this fossil matches up with. Every vivosaur needs to be matched to
no fossils, one of all four parts, or a Single one, or the game will break.

0x1C-0x1F is the buying price of the fossil, while 0x20-0x23 is the selling price.
