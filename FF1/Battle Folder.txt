Unique to FF1 is a folder named "battle." Within this folder is a variety of small files, each given the
cryptic name of simply a number. However, I was able to ascetain that these files actually store the definition
for the teams of the various NPCs, and from there I have been working out many things about the files.

If you would just like to see all of that information, I have made a human-readable collection of it in the
form of the file "Battle Files Teams.txt." I have also included the python script I used to generate it,
namely ff1_teamsOutput.py. However, if you would like to actually edit that file, here is what I found:


0x64-0x65 are the name of the fighter in question. This value corresponds to a certain chunk in
text/japanese; if you split it apart with my editor, you can simply look for the file whose name begins
with this number in textFiles.

The vivosaurs start at 0x94. We get four bytes of ID, then four bytes of Level, and then four bytes that are
always 00 00 00 00. If there are less than three vivosaurs on the team, their bytes simply do not exist, and
we skip on to the next bit.

After the vivosaur/level data is four bytes per vivosaur whose purpose is unknown; the values often increment,
though. Then we have another set of four bytes per vivosaur, which are completely unknown to me.

Finally, after 8-24 bytes, we get to the number of moves. These are, again, four per vivosaur on the team.
You know you're here when you get one to three four-byte integers in a row that are between 1 and 4.
