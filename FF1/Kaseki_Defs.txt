This file determines the data for the various fossils. For you see, "kaseki" is Japanese for
"fossil."

FF1's Kaseki_Defs are far less useful than FFC's. For the normal 100 vivosaurs, their fossils are
completely hardcoded by location, from chunks 1 to 400. That is, Daspleto's head is at chunk 5 simply
because Daspleto is the second vivosaur (by Number), and its Head is the first part (coming after T-Rex's
four).

0x08-0x09 is the ID of the image used by the fossil. This ID corresponds to the name of certain files
inside the image folder, namely ones that begin with "kaseki." The format is kaseki_*ID*_XXX. Within that
ID, there is itself a logic, in that the 0XX's are heads, the 1XX's are bodies, the 2XX's are arms,
the 3XX's are legs, etc.

0x18-0x1B is the buying price of the fossil in the store, and 0x1C-0x1F is the selling price.

I have found that 0x34 is the number of points you need to get for the cleaning to be a success.
Thus, this is 50 for all the normal fossils.
