EVERYTHING IS LITTLE-ENDIAN

etc/btl_kp_defs controls how much FP you have per hero level. Each row's 0x?C is the level number, then
the next row's 0x?0-0x?1 are the max FP recharge, and that row's 0x?2-0x?3 and 0x?6-0x?7 are the recharge
per turn. Presuambly, one of these is for you, and the other is for enemies. Or not, I don't know, because
they're always the same in vanilla.


This one is certainly a mouthful: etc/creature_evolution_abilityup_param_defs controls the stat boosts of
Gold and Silver fossils. The first 16 bytes are a header thing, then each set of 12 bytes are the fossil's
data: two bytes for ID, two bytes for Health boost, two bytes for Attack boost, two bytes for Defense boost,
two bytes for Accuracy boost, and two bytes for Speed boost. All values are what you get if the fossil is
cleaned to a full 100 points. In terms of order, it starts with the Gold fossil, then the Silver Head, then
the Body, then the Arms, and finally the Legs.
