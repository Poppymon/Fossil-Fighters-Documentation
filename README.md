# Fossil-Fighters-Documentation
The documentation stuff in Chunk Editor was getting kind of unwieldy, and I discovered the stuff for teams
which is very important but also very much not chunked. So I decided to make a new repo with all my
documentation in it, and take the opportunity to clean some stuff up too.

If you somehow got here without going through Chunk Editor, please do check it out! It can be found at
