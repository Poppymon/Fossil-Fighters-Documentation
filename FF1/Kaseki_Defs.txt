FF1's Kaseki_Defs are far less useful than FFC's. For the normal 100 vivosaurs, their fossils are
completely hardcoded by location, from chunks 1 to 400. That is, Daspleto's head is at chunk 5 simply
because Daspleto is the second vivosaur (by Number), and its Head is the first part (coming after T-Rex's
four).

The only information we have on these chunks is that 0x08-0x09 is the ID of the image used by the fossil.
This ID corresponds to the name of certain files inside the image folder, namely ones that begin with
"kaseki." The format is kaseki_*ID*_XXX. Within that ID, there is itself a logic, in that the 0XX's are
heads, the 1XX's are bodies, the 2XX's are arms, the 3XX's are legs, etc.

Also, I have found that 0x34 is the number of points you need to get for the cleaning to be a success.
Thus, this is 50 for all the normal fossils.
