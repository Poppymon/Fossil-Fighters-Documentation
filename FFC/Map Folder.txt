EVERYTHING IS LITTLE-ENDIAN

The Map folder is split into five sub-folders:
	- c's use is unknown, but speculated to involve the Camera
	- e sets out the various Excavation zones in each digsite
	- m defines various parameters for the map, along with saying which vivosaurs can be found in each numbered zone
	- r contains all NPCs, loading zones, etc.

Within them, all files are numbered, according to map ID. Unlike FF1, no-one has worked out all the map IDs. However, thanks to the pictures mentioned below, you
should be able to get a good idea which is which.

All the folders except m are of the type GRD, i.e. "grid." Thus, if you remove the first 20 bytes of the file, then set HxD to display a number of bytes per row equal to
bytes 4-8, you end up with a picture of the map telling you where everything is. For excavation, specifically, FFC-E-Maps-Color.zip in this folder shows renditions of that
made using Python.

M is a little different, and its full purpose has not yet been divined. Unlike FFC, we have not worked out the structure for fossil data, either, but we do know that it uses
tables of individual fossils, instead of vivosaur IDs.
